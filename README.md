# College Hoops

This is a bracketology project seeking to understand whether we can predict the winners for each March Madness matchup based on their season and conference tournament results.  Primarily, we're interested in just the team scores and home advantage to predict.  Future projects might include player stats and use injury status to create a more nuanced prediction tool.

Enjoy the madness!

# Scraping Input Data

In order to create the input data sets for this project, I opted to scrape the data from "https://www.sports-reference.com" using the "BeautifulSoup" Python package (see Conda env section below for details on how to install).  For the original scope of this project I've included results for seasons 2021-2025 (2025 may not include NCAA tournament), however you can always use the "Team Scraper" notebook to grab more seasons as needed.

#### Note: If you create a season data set only a few games into an ongoing season, you might have to delete the data set and re-run the scraper to include additional games.  It's highly encouraged to create the data set at the end of the conference tournament stage of the season if you want to use it for an ongoing season prior to filling out your brackets.

# Ratings Systems

The rating systems applied in the matchup prediction are as follows:
1. Colley
2. Massey
3. Adjusted Elo
4. Elo
5. SRS
6. Combined (using numerical analysis)

#### Rating Systems Notes

- Adjusted Elo rating system applies margin of victory (MOV) to rating value.
- Combined rating normalizes all rating systems and uses numerical analysis to step through weights for each rating value (increments of 0.25 between -1 and 1)

# Manually Creating Tournament CSV's

The tournament data sets must be manually created if you choose to run the tool for seasons outside the orignal scope of this project (2021-2025 included here).

Here's an idea of how to do so using the [2025 ESPN bracket](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bracket):
- Start with upper left, add teams in order as they appear

- Apply team names (and scores if tournament is completed) in the round order for each matchup
- Start with upper left, continue to lower left region
- Finish with upper right and lower right regions
- Add winners in matchup order as rounds progress

## Conda environment

When setting up the project, consider using a conda environment to isolate the required packages.

1. Create new conda environment (you can also use PyCharm's interpreter settings to create your conda environment instead of using command line here)
```
conda env create --name desk-cycle
```
2. Add packages to conda
```
conda install anaconda::pandas
```
```
conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4
```
```
conda install anaconda::lxml
```
```
conda install anaconda::html5lib
```
3. Set up jupyter for conda environment ([sauce](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39604271/conda-environments-not-showing-up-in-jupyter-notebook))

```commandline
pip install jupyter ipykernel
```
```commandline
python -m ipykernel install --user --name desk-cycle --display-name "desk-cycle"
```
